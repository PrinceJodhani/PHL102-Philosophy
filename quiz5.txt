Imagine if your friend is injured at night in a car accident and there is no one around to help but only you. There is a medical shop in front of you, but it is closed, and medication is required immediately to keep your friend alive. Without immediate medication, your friend can die. So, in this situation, you need to steal some medication from that medical shop to cure your friend and bring happiness to his face. From the "Act Utilitarianism" point of view, it is good to steal so that person gets happiness again. However, The Rule Utilitarianism says, it is wrong to steal anything. "Do not steal" is a rule to keep happiness around people. In short, considering Act Utilitarianism, it is good to bring happiness by stealing small things. So, more people become happy. In contrast, it is against the rule of "Rule Utilitarianism". because "do not steal" is a rule that makes most people happy. So now, by taking this example, both "Act Utilitarianism" and "Rule Utilitarianism" are right and wrong. This is the difference between both Act and Rule Utilitarianism.
